My personal opinion is that valuation models argue whether something will go up 10%  or 20% if it works. But the real question is if it works at all. You absolutely need to discount it by it's risk or it's a useless number.  In fact the medium term price is best looked at as the expected value = <eventual value> * <chance of success>. Price changes seem to happen as we update our mental estimate of <chance of success>. 

If ETH is 30-300k, then the current price implies a 90-99% estimation of failure by the market. I think the risk is lower than this, therefore the expected value is higher.

In cryptoassets the risk could be anywhere from 0-100%. If it's ~100% then all valuation models are useless, because it's all going to zero when a black swan hits. So the number we need to obsess about is the risk and its end to reach. That reflects the zero to one journey we are on. 

I see it as most important to monitor the biggest risks and metrics: hacks/bugs, regulation, and product market fit compared to competitors. Also the team and founders. I think Eth is doing well.
